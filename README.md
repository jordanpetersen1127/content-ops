## Develop with Netlify Visual Editor Locally

The typical development process is to begin by working locally. Clone this repository, then run `npm install` in its root directory.

Run the Next.js development server:

```txt
cd jordan-petersen-porfolio
npm run dev
```

Install the [Netlify Visual Editor CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stackbit/cli). Then open a new terminal window in the same project directory and run the Netlify visual editor dev server:

```txt
npm install -g @stackbit/cli
stackbit dev
```

This outputs your own Netlify visual editor URL. Open this, register, or sign in, and you will be directed to Netlify's visual editor for your new project.
